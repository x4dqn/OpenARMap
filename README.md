# OpenARMap

**OpenARMap** is a community-driven initiative to build an open, GPS-anchored 3D mapping infrastructure for spatial computing. Our mission is to let anyone with a smartphone capture, share, and reuse high-fidelity 3D scans (Gaussian Splats) of the physical world—streets, parks, buildings, public spaces—without relying on closed platforms or proprietary ecosystems.

Every scan becomes part of a living digital twin: anchored with transparent metadata using our open [SplatJSON format](docs/splatjson-spec.md), freely exportable, and interoperable with tools like Unity, WebXR, and Cesium.** From education and research to public art and civic planning, OpenARMap is designed to support open participation, long-term accessibility, and real-world utility.

We believe spatial computing should be public infrastructure. OpenARMap is how we build it—together.

## Project Status

This repository contains the **mobile capture application** and **open data standards** that form the foundation of the OpenARMap ecosystem. The Android app captures spatial data for 3D reconstruction, automatically generating metadata in our open [SplatJSON format](docs/splatjson-spec.md) for maximum interoperability. It records image sequences, ARCore camera poses, GPS coordinates, and IMU sensor data designed to feed into downstream Gaussian splatting pipelines for fast, high-quality 3D reconstruction and global alignment.

While the current focus is on mobile capture and open standards development, this repository will eventually house the full OpenARMap codebase, including reconstruction tools, cloud pipelines, and web-based visualization.

We're releasing this early-stage mobile app to kickstart development, invite collaborators, and begin testing participatory mobile scanning in real-world conditions.

## Coming Soon: Contributor Login and Cloud Pipeline

We are actively building out user authentication and cloud integration to support a seamless contributor workflow. This will enable users to:

- Log in via email-based authentication (mobile-first)
- Capture scans using the OpenARMap Android app
- Upload scans directly to the cloud
- View and manage their uploaded scans on the web, including metadata, filtering, and map-based visualization

As part of this pipeline, each scan will be automatically paired with a structured .splatjson metadata file. This file contains GPS coordinates, orientation, device and capture metadata, file URLs, and licensing information—enabling integration with maps, viewers, and third-party spatial tools.

We are also enhancing the mobile app to support more complete metadata capture, backend integration, and foundational features such as contributor identity, scan validation, and sync status tracking.

These features lay the groundwork for a seamless end-to-end contributor experience—from capture to upload to public sharing. While the full platform is still in development, the OpenARMap Android app already enables high-quality, offline-first spatial data collection.

The section below describes what the app can do **today**, and how you can start capturing scans immediately.


## Mobile App for Data Capture

The OpenARMap Android app is the foundation of our ecosystem. It allows anyone to capture georeferenced image sequences and sensor data that power downstream reconstruction, anchoring, and sharing. Whether you're contributing to public spatial datasets or exploring your environment in 3D, this tool is where it all begins.

The sections below refer specifically to the mobile capture tool. If you're looking to test early scanning workflows or contribute to real-world spatial data collection, you're in the right place.

## Features

- Real-time camera tracking using ARCore
- Automatic frame capture with quality assessment
- GPS location tracking for outdoor scans
- IMU data capture (accelerometer and gyroscope)
- Export functionality with SplatJSON metadata format
- Export functionality with INRIA-compatible format
- Scan management (rename, delete, export)
- Quality metrics for optimal capture

## Prerequisites

- Android device with ARCore support
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher
- Google Play Services
- Camera and location permissions
- Storage permissions for exporting data

   - Wait for the app to install and launch

## Usage

### Capturing Scans

1. Launch the app and grant necessary permissions
2. Press "Start Scan" to begin a new capture session
3. Enter a name for your scan (optional)
4. Move your device slowly through the space:
   - Keep the camera pointed at textured surfaces

### Export File Structure

The app exports data in a format compatible with the INRIA Gaussian Splatting pipeline:

```
OpenARMaps/Exports/
└── ScanName_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── frame_000.jpg
    │   ├── frame_001.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── metadata/
        ├── transforms.json
        └── session_[ID].json
        └── scan_id.splatjson
```

## Using with INRIA Gaussian Splatting

1. Export your scan from the app
2. Copy the exported folder to your computer
3. Follow the INRIA pipeline setup:
```bash
# Clone the INRIA repository
git clone https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting.git
cd gaussian-splatting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Process your scan
python train.py --source_path /path/to/your/scan
```

### Accessing the Viewer

The INRIA pipeline includes a built-in viewer for visualizing the results:

1. After training, locate the output directory (usually `output/[timestamp]`)
2. Launch the viewer:
```bash
python viewer.py --path /path/to/output/directory
```

The viewer supports:
- Interactive camera controls
- Point cloud visualization
- Splat rendering
- Quality metrics display
